# Hardening log

Running record of the autonomous hardening pass (started 2026-10-13). One entry per fix: what, why, how it was verified.
Open items that need a product decision are listed at the bottom.

## 2026-10-13

### 1. Patch vulnerable server dependencies (`harden/deps`)
- `npm audit` (prod deps) reported 1 critical, 7 moderate, 1 low.
- Updated in place, lockfile only, within existing semver ranges: `proxy-addr` 2.0.8 (critical: IP spoofing via IPv4-mapped IPv6), `qs` 6.16.0 (array-limit bypass, DoS), `dompurify` 3.4.17.
- `npm audit fix` was not used. It also hoisted `react`/`react-router` copies to the root, which broke the typecheck.
- Remaining 5 moderate:
  - `react-router` 6.x open-redirect / constructor-injection advisories. The fix needs a major upgrade to v7, tracked below.
  - `@tensorflow/tfjs` → `argparse` / `sprintf-js`, a CLI-only dependency path that is never executed in the browser.
- Verified: typecheck, build, 154/154 tests.

## Open items (need a decision or larger change)
- react-router v6 → v7 upgrade to clear the remaining advisories. Our own `next=` handling goes through `safeNext`; check whether any `<Link>`/`navigate` takes user input.
